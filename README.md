# Chateau

- Project is currently alpha-stage, more or less, and built with Unity 2022.2.0b16.
- The artwork and music are completely placeholder, either my own quick stub-ins or borrowed from something published to get a feel for part of the experience in a more polished form.
- The intro and tutorialization are probably not adequate for most people yet; I like things to be somewhat obtuse, but not frustrating, especially since a couple of the mechanics are a little novel.
- And of course I'd still like to add a lot more variety to the items and monsters and get the hub area and level generation and dialogue and co-op tightened up and all that.
- Ignore the minimap being visible all the time, if you can; it was just added and will eventually show only if you've picked up a map item.

- But with all that said, it *should* be possible to play all the way through to the credits scene (which I had quite a lot of fun with, actually) without hitting any showstopping bugs or requiring any console codes or anything.
