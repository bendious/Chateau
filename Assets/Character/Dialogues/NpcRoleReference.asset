          - Ah, slimes.
          - They're slow, but be sure you don't get swarmed!
          - They can even slither right past an unwary defense.

          - Snakes?
          - Of course it had to be snakes.
          - They're quick, so stay on your toes!
          - If you get up above them, though, you're probably safe.

          - Yeah, we've got some big ones around here, don't we?
          - They're pretty skittish, even so; you never know where they're heading
            next.
          - Dropping from above seems to be one of their favorite tactics, though.

          - Bats, yes!
          - So easy to miss!
          - But keep your ears open, and they'll run themselves right into their
            own demise.

          - Skeletons?
          - Oh, those things.
          - Talk about litterbugs, am I right?
          - Smash right through their defenses if you dare, or knock open a hole
            from a distance.
          - You can even rip off pieces by hand!
          - My favorite is when I can slip a blade past to their core in one shot.

          m_followUp:
          - Hmm, the worst; shadows...
          - They look like people, don't they?
          - But they're more like an absence than a presence...
          - They're sneaky.
          - Don't trifle with them. Deal with them quickly and they're no big deal,
            but let them alone and before you know it pain will be striking from
            the darkness.

          - Sounds familiar, but I must admit I can't recall where I've heard it.
