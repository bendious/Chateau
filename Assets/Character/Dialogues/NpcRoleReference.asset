          - Ah, slimes.
          - They're slow, but be sure you don't get swarmed!
          - They can even slither right past an unwary defense.
          - They don't care about physical damage or electricity so much, but heat'll
            melt right through 'em.

          m_followUp:
          - Armadillo lizards, to be precise.
          - Or at least, they seem related.
          - They're tough little guys, that's for sure.
          - Especially against physical attacks.
          - But whatever you use, you'll just have to keep at it 'til they drop.
          - At least they're slow, right?

          m_preconditionName: EnemyTypeHasSpawned
          m_userdata: 2
          m_followUp:
          - Snakes?
          - Of course it had to be snakes.
          - Since they're always so close to the ground, they deal very well with
            things like electricity and chemicals.
          - And they're quick, so stay on your toes!
          - If you get up above them, though, you're probably safe.

        - m_text: Frogs
          m_preconditionName: EnemyTypeHasSpawned
          m_userdata: 3
          m_followUp:
          - Ew.
          - I swear, if they try to lick me <i>one</i> more time, I swear I'll...
          - ...figure out why they do that and get them to stop! I don't care how
            delicious I look to them!
          - Their colors are nice, sure, but that just means 'AVOID! POISON!', you
            know.
          - What you might not know is that they're also rather protected from electricity.
          - Unfortunately, you usually have to let them get close before they'll
            stop moving for one second so you can off 'em.

        - m_text: Bats
          m_preconditionName: EnemyTypeHasSpawned
          m_userdata: 4
          m_followUp:
          - Bats, yes!
          - Shockingly easy to miss!
          - Being practically blind is both an advantage and a disadvantage.
          - Keep your ears open, and they'll run themselves right into their own
            demise.
          m_eventName: 
          m_breakAfterward: 0
        - m_text: Bone Piles
          m_preconditionName: EnemyTypeHasSpawned
          m_userdata: 5
          m_followUp:
          - Yeah, you definitely have some skeletons in your closets, buddy.
          - Talk about litterbugs, am I right?
          - Don't bother trying to slice 'em up or burn 'em or anything. Blunt force
            trauma all the way.
          - Smash right through their defenses if you dare, or knock open a hole
            from a distance.
          - You can even rip off pieces by hand!
          - My favorite is when I can slip past to their core in one shot. The rest
            of the pile'll just collapse!
          m_eventName: 
          m_breakAfterward: 0
        - m_text: Spiders
          m_preconditionName: EnemyTypeHasSpawned
          m_userdata: 6
          m_followUp:
          - Yeah, we've got some big ones around here, don't we? At least they're
            not much for web-building.
          - They're pretty skittish, even so; you never know where they're heading
            next.
          - Dropping from above seems to be one of their favorite tactics, though.
          - Despite the old adage, fire isn't a particularly good way to kill 'em.
          - Sprays and such don't really excel either, given how chemically well-developed
            they are. <i>We're</i> the ones still learning from <i>them</i> when
            it comes to venom and silk and all.
          - 'Just smash ''em, honestly: spiders have surprisingly fragile bodies,
            since they''re basically just hydraulic-powered balloons.'
          m_eventName:

        - m_text: Shadows
          m_preconditionName: EnemyTypeHasSpawned
          m_userdata: 7
          m_followUp:
          - Hmm, the worst; shadows...
          - They look like people, don't they?
          - But they're more like an absence than a presence...
          - They're sneaky.
          - Don't trifle with them. Deal with them quickly and they're no big deal,
            but let them alone and before you know it pain will be striking from
            the darkness.
          m_eventName:

        - m_text: '"The Flames"'
          m_preconditionName: SecretFound
          m_userdata: 0
          m_followUp:
          - The Flames? You're referring to the Eternal Fires, yes?
          - They are...
          - Well, how can one even explain them?
          - Perhaps only by their effects.
          - They keep this place from freezing, first of all.
          - And it's been said that they warm the soul in other ways, as well, depending
            on the intention.
          - That's what the display pillars around here are for.
          - To request particular benefits.
          - Of course, that's all just pious nonsense, as I'm sure you can see.

          m_followUp:
          - '"The King", eh?'
          - Sounds familiar, but I must admit I can't recall where I've heard it.
          m_eventName:

          m_followUp:
          - '"The Six Flames"?'
          - I know of the Flames, of course, but the reference to six of them is
            unusual.
          - How would so many even be lit at the same time?
